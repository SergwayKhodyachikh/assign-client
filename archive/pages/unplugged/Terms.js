      <h2>General</h2>
      <p>
        Please read these terms of use (the “Terms”) carefully before using the websites of Assign,
        Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively “Assign”). By accessing, browsing or using these
        websites, you acknowledge that you have read, understood and agree to be bound by these
        Terms and to comply with all applicable laws and regulations, including United States export
        and re-export control laws and regulations, diversion contrary to United States export laws
        is prohibited. If you do not agree to these Terms, you are not authorized to use these
        websites. These Terms govern your use of the websites, any content (such as text, data,
        information, software, graphics or photographs) that Assign may make available through the
        websites (collectively, “Materials”) and any services that Assign may provide through the
        websites (collectively, “Services”). The websites, Materials and Services are referred to in
        these terms collectively as the “Assign Websites.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Assign reserves the right to modify these Terms, or change or remove features of Assign
        Websites. We will notify you of any material change to these Terms by sending you an email
        or by posting a notice of the modification on Assign Websites. If we make a material change,
        you may terminate this agreement within 30 days of us sending you the email or posting the
        notification. Your continued use of Assign Websites after the date of the modification shall
        be deemed acceptance of the modified Terms or agreement, as applicable. Additional or
        different Terms, conditions and notices may apply to specific materials, information,
        products, software or services offered through the Assign Websites. In the event of any
        conflict, such additional or different terms, conditions and notices will prevail over these
        Terms. Please see the applicable agreement or notice.
      </p>
      <p>
        These Terms include the Community Participation Terms of Use, and the terms and conditions
        set forth in the Community Participation Terms of Use are incorporated herein by reference.
        These Terms, together with any additional terms to which you agree when using particular
        elements of the Assign Websites, constitute the entire and exclusive and final statement of
        the agreement between you and Assign with respect to the subject matter hereof, superseding
        any prior agreements or negotiations between you and Assign with respect to such subject
        matter. These Terms and the relationship between you and Assign shall be governed by the
        laws of the State of California as applied to agreements made, entered into and performed
        entirely in California by California residents, not withstanding your actual place of
        residence. All lawsuits arising from or relating to these Terms or your use of the Assign
        Websites shall be brought in the Federal or State courts located in Santa Clara County,
        California, and you hereby irrevocably submit to the exclusive personal jurisdiction of such
        courts for such purpose. The failure of Assign to exercise or enforce any right or provision
        of these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. If any provision of
        these Terms is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, you nevertheless
        agree that the court should endeavor to give effect to the intentions of Assign and you as
        reflected in the provision, and that the other provisions of these Terms remain in full
        force and effect. These Terms shall remain in full force and effect notwithstanding any
        termination of your use of the Assign Websites. These Terms will be interpreted without
        application of any strict construction in favor of or against you or Assign. These Terms,
        and any rights and licenses granted hereunder, may not be transferred or assigned by you,
        but may be assigned by Assign without restriction.
      </p>
      <h2> Use of Software</h2>
      <p>
        To the extent that Assign provides for the download of proprietary Assign software or open
        source software from Assign’s Websites (“Software”), such Software is protected by the
        applicable copyright, patent or other intellectual property rights of either Assign or the
        third party licensor. Any use of the Software is subject to the terms of the applicable
        end-user or open source license agreement.
      </p>
      <p>
        All evaluation Software is provided “AS IS” for evaluation and internal use only. You may
        not use evaluation Software for commercial, development or production purposes. In addition,
        evaluation Software may be time-disabled and may cease to operate after a period of time.
      </p>
      <h2>Trademarks</h2>
      <p>
        Assign reserves all rights to its trademarks, service marks and logos, which together with
        the trademarks, service marks and logos of subsidiaries of Assign will be collectively
        referred to as “Assign Marks.
      </p>
      <p>
        No employee or other representative of Assign is authorized to grant permission to use
        Assign Marks or to provide guidance in their use, unless licensed within a formal written
        agreement. Thus, any promise or other representation with respect to Assign Marks by a
        Assign employee in the absence of a formal written agreement cannot be relied upon.
      </p>
      <p>
        {' '}
        The Assign Marks are highly valued intellectual property, and therefore Assign will take the
        necessary steps to guard against dilution and the use of third-party marks which are
        confusingly similar to Assign Marks or which are likely to cause confusion with Assign
        Marks.
      </p>
      <p>
        If a formal written agreement licenses one or more of the Assign Marks, unless the agreement
        provides other authorization, the use will be in accordance with the guidelines posted at:
        <a href="/#"> https://www.Assign.com/brand/portal/guidelines.html.</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        Assign does not object to the use of the Assign Marks (other than logos) to refer
        specifically to the products of Assign. However, a purely referential use or nominative fair
        use of the Assign Marks must be in plain text. Qualified legal counsel should be consulted
        in order to distinguish a referential use from an infringing use.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the United States, registered Assign Marks should be designated by the symbol “®”, while
        unregistered Assign Marks should be identified by a “™” designation. The Assign Marks must
        be used as adjectives, rather than as nouns or verbs.

      <h2> Linking To Assign Websites</h2>
      <p>

      <h2>Links to Third Party Sites</h2>
      <p>
        Links on the Assign Websites to third-party websites are provided solely for your
        convenience. If you access those links, you will leave the Assign Websites. Assign does not

      <h2> Anti-Piracy/License Compliance</h2>
      <p>
        Assign protects its technology vigilantly and permits others to use it by virtue of license
        agreements. The use or distribution of Assign software without permission from Assign is
        software piracy. Assign distributes and sells its product through a channel network of
        distributors and resellers worldwide. Assign does not distribute or sell its product through
        unauthorized channels such as auctions, peer-to-peer networking, or through illegal download
        sites offering key or serial number generators. If you are contemplating or have obtained
        Assign software through one of these avenues, you likely will find yourself with pirated
        software. Please contact Assign here for assistance with your own or another’s unauthorized
        use of Assign software.
      </p>
      <p>
        Assign also understands that some customers may have challenges with managing their software
        licenses. In these instances, Assign’s License Compliance team may assist by reviewing
        deployment records and reconciling them with Assign’s internal entitlement records. The goal
        of this program is to educate Assign’s customers on the terms of their licenses with Assign
        and to bring the entitlement records in line with usage. Please contact Assign’s License
        Compliance team with questions or issues about your company’s usage at
        licensecompliance@Assign.com.
      </p>
      <h2>Indemnification</h2>
      <p>
        You agree to indemnify, defend and hold harmless Assign, its parents, subsidiaries and other
        affiliated companies (and the respective officers, directors, employees or agents of any
        such entities) from and against any and all claims, liabilities, damages, losses, costs,
        expenses and fees (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) that such parties may incur as a
        result of or arising from your (or anyone using your account, computer or software’s) use of
        the Assign Websites or violation of these Terms. Assign reserves the right to assume the
        exclusive defense and control of any matter otherwise subject to indemnification by you and,
        in such case, you agree to cooperate with Assign’s defense of such claim, and in no event
        may you agree to any settlement affecting Assign without Assign’s written consent.
      </p>
